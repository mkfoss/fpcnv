Purpose - process dbf files with speed, perform user defined jobs on them

Task one - filesystem operations, open and close.
Task two - read header
Task three - read fields

Minimum Bytes for file == Hdr(32) + one Fld(32) + FldTerm 0x0D(1) + Backlink info(263) = 328 + at least 1 record size

Architecture
    FPCnv
        - container for all info about the dbf
        - hands out chunks of work.
    FPProcessor
        - receives a chunk of bytes to process - raw bytes in n * recorsize chunks
        - processes each record...
